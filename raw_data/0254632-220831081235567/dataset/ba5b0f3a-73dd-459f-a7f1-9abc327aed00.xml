            <abstract>
                    <para>The Fishes of Texas Project aims to provide reliable occurrences of fishes from the entire extents of all of the drainage basins that intersect Texas. Starting in 2006 with the database of specimens held in the University of Texas&amp;#39; Ichthyology Collection (TNHCi), we added specimen data collected from our study area from all of the museums we could find to create the Fishes of Texas database. At the time, many of those were not online and all had their data in diverse formats and development of biodiversity data standards was in its infancy. We laboriously compiled these disparate sources into a schema derived from that of the Specify Collections Management software, normalizing formats and taxonomy in the process. We retain the verbatim data received from the specimen owners, but then did our own processing and quality control. We independently manually georeferenced all records, then reviewed species maps and, as possible, examined specimens for as many geographic outliers as possible, finding and correcting misidentified records, and photographing specimens and original labels of most specimens examined. The institutions holding all examined specimens have been informed of our re-determinations and other corrections, but we do not control repatriation, so users may find our records for some specimens conflict with the data they might now independently publish. The database continues to grow and evolve, but at the time of this writing it includes data from 44 specimen-holding collections, and will soon diversify to include data from non-specimen sources. Thus, the data have been carefully and thoroughly curated and verified providing a readily accessible, high-quality dataset that still contains many records that are still not openly published, for used by researchers and resource managers interested in the fish fauna of Texas and adjoining parts of its river basins. The same data can also be queried and explored in diverse ways via at (http://www.fishesoftexas.org), where users will also find additional documentation and other data-exploration tools. Please use our contact information there to notify us of any errors or other issues.</para>

Data were obtained based on database searches or personal requests for data from that area. In many cases provider databases lacked the data fields to allow discovery of those records, in which case we requested data from larger geographic areas (eg. country).

            <purpose>
                <para>This project addresses a long-needed effort to bring together in one database the world-wide museum holdings on the fishes of Texas (later non-specimen data as well). Before this project, museum data were only available from many disparate and often hard to find sources located in several countries and managed in various incompatible databases. Some of these museums lacked digital record of their collections and had paper ledgers only. Many are small museums that do not offer their data online. Some have no catalog at all, except what is recorded on jar labels. Extensive efforts were made to find, compile, format, and standardize data from these museums into one database.</para>

                            <para>Records from many disparate sources have been brought into a common format and standardized (taxa names, dates, and collector names in particular) allowing them to be queried in a single database. Localities have been georeferenced (including error estimate) if possible. These steps allowed us to map the records of each species and detect spatial and temporal outliers, which we flagged as &quot;suspect&quot;. Early versions of the database were strictly specimen based and we&apos;ve made extensive efforts to find specimens that we flagged and examine them to correct determination errors.

                    <para>This is the database of the Fishes of Texas Project (www.fishesoftexas.org). The project aims to bring together in one database all of the specimen data pertaining to fishes of Texas. Initial efforts focused on specimen data, which we believe should be the foundation of our knowledge about Texas fish biogeography, but recognizing the value of other types of data, later efforts include the addition of non-specimen data.</para>
